#### ✨ OpenStack Vs Kubernetes
1. [No, Kubernetes is Not the New OpenStack, Says Canonical](https://containerjournal.com/topics/container-ecosystems/no-kubernetes-is-not-the-new-openstack-says-canonical/)

###### OpenStack might appeal to telcos, which are “more prone to adopting configuration management type approaches, where workloads have to be stateful and long-running.”

###### Kubernetes, meanwhile, is better-suited for workloads that are deployed as REST- or HTTP-based services.
   
2. [Running Kubernetes at Scale Top 2020 Challenge](https://containerjournal.com/topics/container-management/running-kubernetes-at-scale-top-2020-challenge/)

###### According to the survey, 80% of respondents said they have deployed Kubernetes on a public cloud, while 50% said they have deployed Kubernetes in an on-premises IT environment. Another 12% said they have deployed Kubernetes in an edge computing environment. Of those that have deployed Kubernetes at the edge, well over a third (39%) said they are running Kubernetes in 100 or more locations. Nearly half (47%) of those respondents said they are running 11 or more servers in each location. The top two applications being deployed at the edge are edge gateways/access control (43%) and surveillance and video analytics (32%).
   
3. [OpenShift, Kubernetes and Docker: A Quick Comparison](https://containerjournal.com/topics/container-ecosystems/openshift-kubernetes-and-docker-a-quick-comparison/)

###### Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration solution hosted by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and backed by Google, AWS, Microsoft, IBM, Intel, Cisco Systems and Red Hat.
   
4. [Predictions 2020: The Killer App for Edge Computing in 2020 will be Kubernetes](https://containerjournal.com/topics/container-ecosystems/predictions-2020-the-killer-app-for-edge-computing-in-2020-will-be-kubernetes/)

###### -The Edge and Kubernetes Are Made for Each Other-

###### As is often the case with young technology, edge computing today is a fragmented landscape with multiple players vying for mindshare and attention. These include cloud providers, CDN providers, hosting providers, startups and telcos, each with its own different definitions and use cases

###### There are clearly endless places for edge computing to go—and endless ways for it to get there. That makes flexibility key. To enable these next-generation services while continuing to interoperate with legacy IT, the technologies that power the edge must be deployable and scalable in any type of architecture—edge, cloud or centralized. Remember that part about Kubernetes being entirely hardware and OS-independent?
